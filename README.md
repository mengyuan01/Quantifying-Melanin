# Quantifying-Mel is for quantifying the melanin content by processing zebrafish images.

Procedure: prepare the images; generate mask using sam; select mask by setting conditions or manually; calculate the melanin ratio by grayscale of mask using equation quoted in paper
1.white balance process_wb.py
2.brigtness adjustment.py
3.generating and selecting mask of zebrafish & calculating melanin ratio_bestmask.py
The conditions set are refered in paper, you can set new conditions by editing the code.
#1.manully select mask & calculating melanin ratio_allmask.py
if the selected mask is not you need, you can acquire all masks generated by SAM with the code, and input the number of correct mask.
5.collecting ratio data to excel_ratiotoexcel.py
#6.put mask(.json) and image in a folder to calculate melanin ratio_ui.py
if you already have masks(.json) by labelme.exe, you can use the file(ui.py) to calculate melanin ratio in an interactive window. Allowing self-set threshold and equation selected.

Make sure your computer already downloaded needed packages/modules, especially those mentioned in the front lines of codes.
